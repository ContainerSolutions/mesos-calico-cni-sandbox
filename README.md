# mesos-cni-sandbox

# Background

This is a sandbox repository to experiment with the CNI support in Mesos. 
The goal is to use CNI combined with Project Calico to handle IP-per-task

# Usage

* Start Zookeeper, Master, Agent and Marathon
* Now deploy the python or nginx app on Marathon

# Question

What do I have to do in terms of configuration to have Mesos generate an IP via Project Calico?
